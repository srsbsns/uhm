this program prints information about whats going on in the teeworlds world.
it will contact master- and game servers, print the requested information, 
and then terminate. 
hence, for a continous view, its best run in combination with watch, or in 
the background writing to a file, with watch/tail as its front end.

List of supported parameters: (slightly obsolete)

  -v: increase verbosity

  -f NUMBER: re-request serverlist if at least NUMBER of server short.
    A server list provided by a master server can be incomplete,
      due to the unrelieable nature of UDP, and also as an
      implication of the way teeworlds master servers operate.
    Without -f, any server list is accepted, regardless of whether
      the number of received servers actually matches the amount
      the master server claimed to have available.
    With -f, if the size of the received server list contains at least 
      NUMBER servers less than anounced, a new server list is requested
    Reasonable values for -f start at around 10, lower values will
      usually just slow things down without bringing in any noticable benefit
    Note that the final server list may *still* be short, if we ran
      out of attempts (see -R). However, in this case, the largest
      serverlist acquired while attempting is used as the result, even if short

  -c: enable bash color sequences
  -i: case-insensitive regexps
  -e: hide trailing statusmsg after output (e.g. 'end of player listing')

  -se: do not display empty servers
    By default, servers with one or more attributes matching
      your proviced regular expressions, will be printed out.
    This will prevent empty servers from being printed.

  -sp: for matching servers, display who is playing on it 
    This does not affect the player matching expression specified through -p.
    
  -l NUMBR: in combination with -sp, put NUMBER players on one line
    By default, each player will be displayed on a new line.
    Note that this is unrelated to the actual player matching.
    
  -S: print stats as last line
  -ao do not truncate output file, i.e. append to it
  -aO do not truncate raw output file, i.e. append to it

  -O FILE: print raw (unfiltered) data to file (default: don't print raw)
    The raw output will always contain every server and player,
      but must be explicitely enabled by this option when desired.
    Specify a file, or a dash ``-'' for stdout.

  -o FILE: write output to FILE instead of stdout
  
  -m STRING: specify a comma-seperated list of master servers
    For example: -m master3.teeworlds.com,example.org,127.0.0.1 
    Note that there is no IPv6 support yet, neither here, nor in teeworlds.
      
  -N NUMBER: print as many newlines before outputting
    This might be useful when running inside of some kind of loop-script.
      
  -r NUMBER: number of retries for unresponsive master servers
  -R NUMBER: number of retries for unresponsive game servers
  -T NUMBER: number of threads (default: 20)
    Note that the master servers are always queried sequentially by
      a single thread.
     
  -tm NUMBER: read timeout for master servers in seconds
  -tg NUMBER: read timeout for game servers in seconds

  ---- Matching ----

  -p REGEXP: output all players with name matching REGEXP
    When not specified, any player matches

  -st REGEXP: output all servers with type matching REGEXP
  -sn REGEXP: output all servers with name matching REGEXP
  -sa REGEXP: output all servers with host:port matching REGEXP
  -sm REGEXP: output all servers with map matching REGEXP
  -sv REGEXP: output all servers with version matching REGEXP
    A server matches when at least one attribute matches the given
      expression. A missing expression will never match (unlike
      player matching). Hence, if none of the above arguments
      are specified, no server is printed out at all

  -h : display usage information statement


if you want to see whats going on (to make sure its not stuck), call 
  it with -v, or even with -v -v
